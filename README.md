Currently struggling with making a plan to write a solution to take the cpu cores into account.
If there is only one core, it is simple: just sum up the minutes each tasks will take.
With more than 1 core, it becomes more difficult to take into account if the other cores are free or not 
and then the dependecies of the tasks. 

I tried writing some functions, but all efforts failed due to incorrect approaches.
